Small Object Detection using YOLOv8 with and without SAHI


This project explores the detection of small objects such as earphones, glasses, and helmets using the YOLOv8 object detection model. Small object detection is particularly challenging due to the limited pixel area these objects occupy in images, making it harder for models to accurately identify them.

To enhance detection performance, we compare the results of YOLOv8 alone with YOLOv8 integrated with Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI), a technique designed to improve small object detection by slicing images into smaller patches during inference. This README outlines the methods used, the dataset preparation, and the performance results, showcasing how SAHI can be a valuable tool in improving small object detection accuracy.
